This is a really simple library for using RPCs in ocaml. It's only a couple hundred lines of code, and serves as an alternative to the complex [ocaml-rpc](https://github.com/mirage/ocaml-rpc).
If you'd like me to add some documentation or examples, please feel free to create an issue! I have a simple example in lib/example.ml.
